# Pattern-tessellation
Processing program that demonstrates tessellations
The tessellations are determined from a smaller part that repeats. This part is named a tile, which then
will be repeated over the view output. The input tile will be a grid, and the output will be
a larger grid, which will then be displayed. 
Such tessellations are often known mathematically as Wallpaper Patterns. By changing the pattern
within the Tile, and also adapting how the tiles are mapped onto the main grid, you can alter the final
design. Simple patterns are created by regular mappings, while more complex patterns can be created
by alternating the mappings. Tessellations can employ different mathematical and geometric
transformations.
